# koha-plugin-rest-di

This is a REST API plugin for Koha. It provides extended API support for Discovery Interfaces such as VuFind.

Most of the functionality has been ported from the KohaSuomi version of Koha (see  https://github.com/KohaSuomi/Koha).

Please note that as of 1/2020 this is pretty much work in progress. For instance permissions/authorization is yet to be verified.
